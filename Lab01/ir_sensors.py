"""
Fill in the Blank 2: IR Sensors

This script will give you experience on the event mechanism
for the IR sensors. You will be able to manipulate the data
readings of all 7 sensors, analyze them, and perform simple
robotic tasks depending on the sensor readings.
"""

## TODO: Fill in the blanks below to implement the following 2 functions 
## such that:
##     - The robot is able to detect objects placed in front of it.
##     - The robot is able to determine which side of the robot
##       the object is located.
##     - If the object is on the left side, the robot's ring light
##       will shine red.
##     - If the object is on the right side, the robot's ring light
##       will shine green. 
##    - If the object is right down the middle, the robot's ring light
##       will shine white.

"""
Fun fact: These light configurations are similar to the navigational
lights of a plane or ship!

To aid you in this assignment, all lines that need to be changed will be marked with (TODO) 
in a nearby comment.

Recall: There are seven sensors located at the front and sides of the robot. Each sensor
makes an angle of [-65.3, -38.0, -20.0, -3.0, 14.25, 34.0, 65.3] to the center of the robot.
While the angle information is not important for this script, you will definitely need it in
future robot assignments!

For this script, you can assume that the first 3 sensors are on the left side, the last 3
sensors are on the right side, and the 4th sensor is in the middle of the robot.

# Parameters: readings (a list of 7 elements representing the readings
#     obtained from the 7 sensors)
# Returns: sensorIndex (representing the index of the sensor with the

# Description: This function takes in a list of sensor readings, and returns the
#     index of the sensor with the closest proximity (which is the largest sensor reading).
#     This function should only analyze the sensors with readings that are at least 20.
#     If none of the sensors have readings that are at least 20, return -1.

# Note: You can assume there will be no duplicate values that are at least 20 in the list.

# Recall: You can submit this file to Gradescope to check if this function has been
# implemented correctly!
